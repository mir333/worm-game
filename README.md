# Worms

This is my first attempt to create a remake of an old game from my childhood.
It's a libGDX based game.

if you want to try it out run

```
./gradlew :desktop:run
```

Controles are still hardcoded:

**worm 1:**

Left : Left arrow

Right: Right arrow


**worm 2:**

Left : Q

Right: E

Special ability: W

**worm 3:**

Left : J

Right: L

**worm 4:**

Left : Z

Right: C
